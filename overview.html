			The <strong>TeleSign Java SDK</strong> is a Java&trade; component that provides an interface to <a href="http://www.telesign.com/products-demos/">TeleSign Web Services</a>.
			It contains a Java class library that presents our web services in an intuitive, hierarchical object model, 
			so you can create and manipulate them in the way you're accustomed.
			You can use this SDK to build TeleSign-based web applications in Java code, as MVC 3 web applications, using the Eclipse or NetBeans IDEs.</p>
