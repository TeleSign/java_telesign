			 The Phone Verify web service provides an identity verification solution that uses the telephone to deliver a one-time validation code to your end users. 
			 Upon receiving this code, your users just type it into their computer and send it back to you (or to us if they dial it into their phone). 
			 The validity of their identity is then determined by simply comparing the codes they return to the ones we send them—and a match is considered positive identification.
